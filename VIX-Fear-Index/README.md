# VIX Fear Index – Data Analysis & Machine Learning

This project examines whether movements in the VIX (Volatility Index), often referred to as the “Fear Index”, can be analyzed and modeled using historical market data.

## Research Focus
The work investigates whether volatility dynamics exhibit patterns that can be captured through feature engineering and supervised learning, while respecting the time-dependent nature of financial data.

## Methodology
- Exploratory data analysis to identify volatility regimes
- Feature engineering based on returns, rolling volatility, and trend indicators
- Time-aware model validation to prevent forward-looking bias
- Supervised learning applied to volatility-related targets

## Key Observations
- Volatility behavior is strongly regime-driven and prone to abrupt shifts
- Models capture general dynamics but struggle with extreme events
- Evaluation methodology plays a critical role in the credibility of results

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
