# Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

Hi, I'm Simha Magal — a High-Tech Sciences student specializing in Data Science, Economics, and Business Management.

This portfolio brings together selected academic and personal projects that reflect my approach to data-driven problem solving: analytical thinking, methodological rigor, and a clear connection between technical decisions and real-world context.

Throughout these projects, I approach each problem by examining the data itself, the assumptions behind the models, and the practical constraints shaping the solution.

## Projects Overview

### Flight Delays Analysis (Data Analysis & Machine Learning)
A large-scale analysis of US domestic flight data (2015, ~5.8M records) combining exploratory data analysis with unsupervised and supervised learning.  
The project emphasizes feature engineering, leakage detection, and model evaluation under real-world constraints such as scale and sparsity.

### VIX Fear Index – Data Analysis & Machine Learning
A financial data project exploring whether movements in the VIX (Volatility Index) can be analyzed and modeled using historical data.  
The work focuses on time-aware feature engineering, proper validation methodology, and interpretation of results in highly uncertain environments.

### B-Side Management System (Backend Development)
A Python-based backend system designed to centralize organizational data for a multi-branch company.  
The project demonstrates object-oriented design, inheritance, separation of concerns, and persistent storage using SQLite, implemented through a structured CLI interface.

### Chrome Extension – Crypto to USD Converter (Frontend Development)
A fully functional Chrome extension developed to enable fast cryptocurrency-to-USD conversion.  
The project combines client-side implementation with deliberate UI design choices, focusing on simplicity, speed, and a single-screen user experience.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, SQL (SQLite), JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Jupyter Notebook

I’m particularly interested in student and junior roles that combine analytical thinking, data interpretation, and system-level understanding.
